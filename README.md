## Brief introduction
Mix MSTAR is a new synthetic SAR vehicle dataset,consisting of 100 large images with 5392 vehicles of 20 fine-grained categories. The geographically contiguous test set can be stitched into four large-scale images. The arrangement of vehicles is diverse, with both tight and sparse groupings and various scenes such as urban, highway, grassland, and forest.
